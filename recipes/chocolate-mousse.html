    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chocolate Mousse may well be the ultimate chocolate fix! Rich and creamy, yet light and fluffy,
        one pot is satisfying but always leaves me wanting more...
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a classic chocolate mousse made the proper French way, as served in fine dining restaurants.
        Less cream, more chocolate, a more intense chocolate flavour and a beautiful creamy mouth feel.
